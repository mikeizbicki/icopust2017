% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.
%
% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to
% Adrienne Griscti ---> griscti@acm.org
%
% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to
% Gerald Murray ---> murray@hq.acm.org
%
% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

\section{Intro}
    Whenever we deploy a machine learning model, 
    we release information about the dataset the model was trained on.
    When the underlying data is sensitive (e.g. contains health record information),
    this sensitive information may leak to the public.

\subsection{applications}
The medical history of Massachusets governor William Welds was discovered in a public health database \cite{sweeney2002k}.
\cite{homer2008resolving} show how to determine whether a person participated in a DNA study.
\cite{narayanan2008robust} showed how to deanonymize the NETFLIX prize data.
\cite{nytimes2006user} chronicles a bad release of search data by AOL.

Microsoft has a C\# library for adding differential privacy to SQL-like queries \cite{mcsherry2010privacy}.
The focus is for nonexperts to be able to run queries with guaranteed privacy.
\cite{roy2010airavat} provides a differentially private interface to Hadoop's MapReduce for cloud computing.
***\cite{hamm2015crowd} provide a library for differentially private, cloud based smart devices.
\cite{qin2016heavy}

\cite{machanavajjhala2008privacy} shows how the US Census bureau releases traffic congestion information without releasing identifying details.

\cite{lindell2011practical} show how to use differential privacy to prevent internet add campaigns from leaking information.

\cite{reed2010differential} allow cloud services to share statistics that help detect botnets without revealing confidential information about users.

\cite{erlingsson2014rappor} and \cite{fanti2016building} shows how Google uses differential privacy to aggregate statistics of Chrome users.
*** \cite{jansen2016tor} uses differential privacy to map out statistics of the TOR network.

\cite{kenthapadi2017bringing} describes salary aggregation at LinkedIn.

\cite{malin2013biomedical} argue that existing differential privacy mechanisms are not good enough.
In order to get reasonable privacy guarantees, we sacrifice too much utility.
They use medical case study of applying warafin (a blood thinning drug) to stroke patients.
The patient's response to warafin exhibits a complex dose response relationship affected by genetic markers.
The learning procedure tries to protect the patient's genetic information while giving a useful model to clinicians.

\cite{hu2015differential} argues that existing privacy guarantees are not good enough for telecommunications applications.

\subsection{Models of privacy}

Many models of privacy have been proposed.
Prominent examples include $k$-anonymity \cite{sweeny2002k}, $l$-diversity \cite{machanavajjhala2007diversity}, $t$-closeness \cite{li2007t}.
Differential privacy is the strongest of these notions of privacy.
All of these models are subject to so called \emph{composition attacks} where external data is used \cite{ganta2008composition}.
Differential privacy, however, is robust even to this type of attack.

\cite{dwork2014algorithmic} is a book on differential privacy.

\cite{kifer2011no} provide a good introduction to the types of data that differential privacy is good for.
Roughly, whenever the data is independent, differential privacy is good.
The quality of the model depends on the background knowledge of the adversary.

An orthogonal technique for preserving the privacy of data is called homomorphic encryption.
Homomorphic encryption allows training a model on untrusted hardware \cite{graepel2012ml}.
For example, encrypted data could be uploaded to a cloud computing provider.
Using homomorphic encryption, the cloud computer would perform the machine learning without decrypting the data.
The user then downloads the results.
Differential privacy is used to protect data when a model has been released publicly 
(without considering the hardware it was trained on);
homomorphic encryption is used to protect data when a model is trained on untrusted data 
(without considering how the model will be used after training).
The methods can be combined.
Learning with homomorphic encryption is orders of magnitude slower than standard learning methods,
and therefore not used in practice.
In contrast, differential privacy does not add any overhead to the learning process and is heavily used.

Mandatory Access Controls are related to homomorphic encryption.

\section{Differential Privacy}

A good tutorial on differentially private machine learning is \cite{ji2016differential}
\cite{shokri2015privacy,abadi2016deep} study differential privacy in machine learning.
\cite{wainwright2012privacy} discus local differential privacy.
\cite{nguyen2016collecting} discuses local dp with better applications to ML; claim the best technique for averaging, which might be useful.

\begin{defn}
    A \emph{mechanism} is a function $\tilde f : X \to A$ that takes as input a data base and outputs a random variable.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ and $Y$ denote two databases.
    The function $d(X,Y)$ represents the distance between these databases.
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ be non-negative real numbers.
    A mechanism $\tilde f$ satisfies $(\epsilon,\delta)$-\emph{differential privacy} if
    \begin{equation}
        P() \le \exp(\epsilon)P()
    \end{equation}
\end{defn}

\begin{defn}
    Let $X$ be a database.
    We call a function $f : X \to S$ a \emph{query} on the database.
\end{defn}
